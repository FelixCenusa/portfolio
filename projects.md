# Projects


## Advent of Code Solutions

Developed comprehensive video tutorials and code solutions for each daily challenge in the [Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/FelixCenusa/Advent-Of-Code-2024). This project demonstrates problem-solving skills and proficiency in various programming concepts.

- **Languages Used:** Python
- **Features:**
  - Daily challenge solutions with detailed explanations
  - Video walkthroughs for all problems
  - Optimized and well-documented code
- **GitHub Repository:** [Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/FelixCenusa/Advent-Of-Code-2024)


## 8-Segment Display Controller (Assembly)

Designed an ARM Assembly program to manage an 8-segment display, enabling it to count up or down based on user input. The system supports input via keyboard and physical push buttons, utilizing both polling and interrupt methods for input handling.

- **Languages Used:** ARM Assembly
- **Features:**
  - Real-time input processing through polling and interrupts
  - Compatibility with keyboard and physical push buttons
  - Configurable counting direction (increment/decrement)
  - Efficient display refresh mechanisms
- **Implementation Details:** Detailed information will be available in the README file upon course completion (expected mid-January).
- **GitHub Repository:** To be published post-course completion (expected mid-January)

## Custom File System with FAT (C++)

Engineered a flexible file system in C++ featuring a custom File Allocation Table (FAT) implementation. The system supports adjustable block sizes and standard file operations, including `ls`, `cd`, `mv`, `cp`, `mkdir`, and `create`.

- **Languages Used:** C++
- **Features:**
  - Adjustable block sizes for adaptable storage solutions
  - Comprehensive file and directory manipulation commands:
    - `ls`: List directory contents
    - `cd`: Navigate between directories
    - `mv`: Move files or directories
    - `cp`: Copy files
    - `mkdir`: Create new directories
    - `create`: Generate new files
  - Streamlined FAT design for enhanced performance
- **Documentation:** Example usage and testing framework will be provided in the README file upon course completion (expected mid-January).
- **GitHub Repository:** To be published post-course completion (expected mid-January)

## FAKE-GPT (python)
![fakegpt](/assets/img/fakegptss.png){:height="400px" width= 600px"}

I call it Fake-GPT since you can chat with it but it is not a real GPT :). The fourth version is the final version and the versions in between I did not include as they just add more features that Marvin4 already has.
- [Link to the project (my github repo)](https://github.com/FelixCenusa/Python-Projects/tree/main/marvin4)
- Run the main.py after cloning or downloading the repo to run the program.

## Press-Ice (python)
![pressice](/assets/img/pressicess.png){:height="400px" width= 600px"}
This is a typing game I made called "Press-Ice" as you must be precise to get a good score. 
It tells you how fast you typed, what mistakes you made and there are different difficulty options.
- [Link to the project (my github repo)](https://github.com/FelixCenusa/Python-Projects/tree/main/typing)
- [Link to a youtube video I made explaining the code and how the program works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf3cHNM08g)
- Run the main.py after cloning or downloading the repo to run the program.

## TIS-100 (Assembly)
Played and completed the entire TIS-100 game which based on assembly language.
