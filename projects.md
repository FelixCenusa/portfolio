I call it Fake-GPT since you can chat with it but it is not a real GPT :). The fourth version is the final version and the versions in between I did not include as they just add more features that Marvin4 already has.

## Press-Ice (python)
![pressice](/assets/img/pressicess.png){:height="400px" width= 600px"}
This is a typing game I made called "Press-Ice" as you must be precise to get a good score. 
It tells you how fast you typed, what mistakes you made and there are different difficulty options.
