- Run the main.py after cloning or downloading the repo to run the program.

## Press-Ice (python)
![pressice](/assets/img/pressicess.png){:height="400px" width= 600px"}
This is a typing game I made called "Press-Ice" as you must be precise to get a good score. 
It tells you how fast you typed, what mistakes you made and there are different difficulty options.

- [Link to a youtube video I made explaining the code and how the program works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf3cHNM08g)
