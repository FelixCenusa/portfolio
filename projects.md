## 8-Segment Display Controller (Assembly)


An Assembly program that controls an 8-segment display to count up or down based on user input. It supports input via keyboard or physical push buttons and includes implementations using both polling and interrupts.

Built with:

Assembly (ARM)

Peripheral interface for buttons and display


Features:

Real-time input handling via polling or interrupt-driven logic

Keyboard and push-button compatibility

Configurable counting behavior (up/down)

Efficient display updates

Example implementation details available in the README file (available once course is over (mid Jan) and I can publish the code)

## FAKE-GPT (python)
![fakegpt](/assets/img/fakegptss.png){:height="400px" width= 600px"}

I call it Fake-GPT since you can chat with it but it is not a real GPT :). The fourth version is the final version and the versions in between I did not include as they just add more features that Marvin4 already has.
- [Link to the project (my github repo)](https://github.com/FelixCenusa/Python-Projects/tree/main/marvin4)
- Run the main.py after cloning or downloading the repo to run the program.

## Press-Ice (python)
![pressice](/assets/img/pressicess.png){:height="400px" width= 600px"}
This is a typing game I made called "Press-Ice" as you must be precise to get a good score. 
It tells you how fast you typed, what mistakes you made and there are different difficulty options.

- [Link to a youtube video I made explaining the code and how the program works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf3cHNM08g)
- Run the main.py after cloning or downloading the repo to run the program.

## TIS-100 (Assembly)
Played and completed the entire TIS-100 game which based on assembly language.
