## FAKE-GPT(python)
I call it Fake-GPT since you can chat with it but it is not a real GPT :). The fourth version is the final version and the versions in between I did not include as they just add more features that Marvin4 already has.

Run the main.py after forking or downloading the repo to run the program.

## Press-Ice(python)
This is a typing game I made called "Press-Ice" as you must be precise to get a good score. 
It tells you how fast you typed, what mistakes you made and there are different difficulty options.
